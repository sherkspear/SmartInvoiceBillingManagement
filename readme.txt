== Description ==
The plugin is ideal for the websites owned by a developer or a company that has clients. 

The plugin sends your clients an email that notifies them with your invoice. Record of your clients will be recorded in your database such as names, name of their companies, emails, contact numbers and etc. Email invoices are in html format , you can contact me if you want or need it to be customized. 

Invoices that are created will be monitored by their statuses. You can send a reminder to your clients through the notification if payment is not yet made. If payment is completed, you can confirm the invoice that the payment is paid. You can also cancel an invoice that is already created.
